Integrations allow you to amplify the capabilities of Telex by connecting with third-party platforms or services to achieve tasks such as:

To optimize and streamline your operations, Telex offers two types of integrations based on your requirements:

- [<u>Connectable Integrations</u>](#connectable-integrations)

### Connectable Integrations

These integrations enable you to link Telex with an existing account/app on a third-party platform or service. By doing so, you gain access to additional features and environment variables that facilitate seamless integration.

When you add a connectable integration through the Telex dashboard, you will be prompted through certain verification steps to ensure the reliability of your connection.
