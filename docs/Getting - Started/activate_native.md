# Activate Native Integrations

Native Integration in Telex is a seamless two-way connection between Telex and third-party applications. These integrations are primarily developed by Telex engineers, ensuring robust functionality and streamlined processes tailored to user needs.

## Activating a Native Integration

Since Native Integrations have already been developed, you can easily activate them from the Telex dashboard. Follow these steps to activate a Native Integration:

1. **Open the Integrations Marketplace**  
   Navigate to the **Apps** section from your Telex dashboard to access the Integrations Marketplace.

2. **Activate a Native Integration**
   Click on Manage Apps and then on Connect App. This will activate the integration for that particular organisation.

3. **Configure the Integration**  
   Provide the necessary configuration details required for the Native Integration. This will involve making changes to the settings of the integration.
